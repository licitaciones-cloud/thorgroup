# Hamburger Menu Fix - Nosotros Page (our.html)

## Problem Description
The hamburger menu on the 'Nosotros' page (our.html) worked only once and then became unclickable. This was due to missing Bootstrap dependencies.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that `vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file didn't exist in the project, causing Bootstrap JavaScript to fail loading. This prevented the navbar collapse functionality from working.

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Bootstrap JS dependency**: 
   - Changed from non-existent `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` to existing `bootstrap.bundle.js`
   - This restored Bootstrap's collapse functionality

2. **Removed duplicate script tag**:
   - Removed duplicate `<script src="assets/js/owl.js"></script>` at the end of the file

3. **Maintained proper dependency chain**:
   - jQuery 3.3.1 (from vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js)
   - Bootstrap bundle JS (from vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.js)
   - Custom scripts

## Results
✅ Hamburger menu now works repeatedly without issues
✅ Proper responsive behavior (hamburger on mobile, full nav on desktop)
✅ No JavaScript errors affecting menu functionality
✅ All Bootstrap components loading correctly

## Testing Performed
- Mobile view (375px): Hamburger menu toggles open/closed repeatedly
- Desktop view (1024px): Navigation auto-expands as expected
- Multiple toggle cycles confirmed working
- Bootstrap dependencies verified loaded

## Files Modified
- `our.html`: Fixed Bootstrap JS dependency and removed duplicate script
